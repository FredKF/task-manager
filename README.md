```
enterSubmit(event: KeyboardEvent): void /*new list on hitting "Enter" key in the input*/

addNewList(event: KeyboardEvent) 

addNewTask(event: KeyboardEvent) : void /*you can also add new tasks and lists by clicking de OK icon*/

```

It's also possible to edit and delete lists and tasks by clicking the "Delete" and "Edit(pencil)" icons. Note that you have to confirm via dialog that you confirm the deletion action
```
openDialog(index: number):void /*will open the confirmation dialog*/

deleteList(index: number) /*will delete current task and list*/

deleteTask(index: number) /*will delete current task and task*/

```

When a task is completed you can click the "Complete Task" icon in order to mark it as completed
```
toggleCompleteTask(task: Task): void /*will toggle complete mark*/

```

The searcher component will filter the tasks list at the same time the user will type. It will filter by containing words.
